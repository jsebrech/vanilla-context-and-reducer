# Vanilla Context and Reducer Example

A port of React's [Scaling Up with Reducer and Context](https://react.dev/learn/scaling-up-with-reducer-and-context) final example to vanilla web code.

Part of the [Plain Vanilla Web](https://plainvanillaweb.com) project.

This makes use of the [tiny-context](https://github.com/jsebrech/tiny-context) library to implement the actual context.

## Running

Run the `vanilla` folder as a static site and browse to it:

```sh
npx http-server vanilla
```

The `react` folder contains the original example's source code for comparison.
